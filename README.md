# avans-mustache

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tokuhirom/avans-mustache.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tokuhirom/avans-mustache)

Mustache bindings for Avans web application framework.

<B>I don't recommend to use this.</B> I suggest to use avans-freemarker instead.
Because mustache has too cheap features for server side templating.

And so, mustache template's markup rule may conflict with client side template engine.
